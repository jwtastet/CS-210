# Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
The purpose of this project was to take a txt file of chronologically purchased items and then
convert that data into a more user friendly format depending upon the users input, based on 
selections given from a menu.

# What did you do particularly well?
I believe what I did well in this project was use the map data type's Key: Value
format to better store the data for later use. I also feel that my display (for being command prompt) 
was well thought out and executed.

# Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
I believe that the code could be enhanced to be more efficient if I were to have utilized an Item object as well

# Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
I didn't find any particular part of writing this project challenging outside of sytnax. 

# What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
I think the skill that will be most transferable is the use of Objects, because of how they need to be structured in C++
it provides a close look as to how they function in other languages as well.

# How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
The program is made adaptable with the use of OOP and is maintainable/readable through the proactive commenting.
Leaving accurate and frequent comments in the code allows for someone to go back through and understand exactly what each function is doing.
